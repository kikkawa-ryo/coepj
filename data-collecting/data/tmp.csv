She studied nutrition at the Federal University of Viçosa and entered the world in search of better professional opportunities. She married João and the couple had two daughters, Sofia and Luisa. Her greatest challenge was when her father passed away and she inherited a “little piece of land.” Simone, her husband, and their two daughters decided to leave work, its stable salary and city life, return to Araponga and bet on high-quality, sustainable coffee production.

Today has over 80 years of tradition and continuous improvement. In 1973, the grandparents and parents left the north of Paraná and came to Franca, in Alta Mogiana, fleeing the frosts that were destroying coffee plantations. The began with 20 hectares and 22,000 coffee pits, with two trees per pit. 44,000 trees were planted, of the varieties Mundo Novo, Red and Yellow Catuaí. All of the seedlings were produced at Sítio Sol Nascente, where they lived. Their first harvest yielded 170 bags, which were sold at record prices. At the time, they reached a price of almost 500 dollars per bag due to the frosts that were decimating coffee crops in other traditional regions. Nowadays, Getulio and Clara Minamihara and their son, Anderson (4th generation), handle operations. As they grew, they bought more land. Today the farms total 150 hectares, with 95 hectares planted with coffee, distributed in 4 properties: Sol Nascente, which only grows avocados; Paineiras, which plants coffee; Ouro Verde and Santa Maria, which have both coffee and avocados. To assure maximum possible quality, all of the coffees are picked separately by property, plot, variety, and point of maturation. Care is also taken with selective hand picking and selective mechanical picking. Drying is natural and slow, partly on covered African beds and partly on asphalt patios. When planting, the producers have always carefully studied which varieties are the most productive, giving preference to the most resistant to diseases and especially to those with the best potential to produce fine drinks. Currently, 45 varieties are grown with diverse sensory nuances, among them Red Catucaí, Red Obatã, Yellow Bourbón, Catucaí Açu, Siriema, Tupi, Rubi, several UFVs and IPR. This diversity is increasing with the inclusion of exotic varieties such as Maragogipe, Sumatra, Sete Favas, Goiaba and Brasil. Minamihara’s differential is that coffee is planted in the shade of avocado trees. The two species are considered friendly plants as avocados help coffee other in terms of microclimate and attracting pests, which results in coffee that is less vulnerable to attacks and needs less pesticide. Moreover, thanks to the shade, the fruits mature more slowly, which increases the concentration of sugars in the beans, resulting in sweet coffee beans. The coffees are protected from pests and diseases by homeopathic treatments, with the use of biological treatments such as fungi and bacteria. The soil is adjusted with marine limestone, made from ground shells and coral. For fertilization, organic compounds certified for organic agriculture are used. Herbicides are not used to control weeds, they are removed by hand or with machinery. All of the coffees are separated and traced with records of farms, plots, varieties, as well as maturation point and manner and place of drying. Once dried, the coffees are stored in rest boxes or in bags."", ""Coffee processing system"", ""Natural"", ""Certification: Organico Brazil"", ""Production Unit SP 718"", ""CA8948/1"", """"], ""tr"": [], ""li"": []}, ""detail"": {""Rank"": ""32"", ""Farm_Name"": ""MINAMIHARA SANTA MARIA 2017"", ""Farmer_Rep_"": ""CLARA K.
