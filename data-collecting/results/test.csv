The couple, parents of three daughters, left the capital with the goal of exploring the black goal of the Chapada Diamantina mountains at 1350 meters of elevation. Both sought information by getting in touch with the locals who already worked in the area, and also through workshops and conventions, to learn the art of producing good coffee."",""At first, despite the climactic conditions favoring the quality of the drink, the technical conditions and the machinery were practically inexistent, and the power grid didn’t reach the farm – this arrived only in 2015, before this the producers used solar power and a generator. As such, production depended on great effort and hard work from the entire family and several workers. They hulled small coffee lots by hand. Little by little, they saved up to buy a pulper, then a washer, and thus conditions improved, enabling a better production process."",""Nowadays the farm has 10 hectares of coffee and and all necessary care for quality. The harvest is done selectively by apanhadeiras de café, women who pick bean by bean, in several stages so that only well-ripened beans are picked. Drying is closely monitored. Then the coffee is processed and warehoused according to established standards."",""The centerpiece of success in production is the participation of the entire family, in all the stages of coffee production, from the beginning until today. The producers’ daughters, Milena (29), Letícia (23) and Cecília (13), since they were young, have lived on the farm and love it, as they love growing coffee and appreciating the drink. They help in the fields, where they have direct contact with the soil, thus deconstructing the erroneous colonial idea that only male children were able to continue the family business."",""Coffee processing system:\nThe processing system is the wet method, pulped natural. After picking, the beans are pulped and spread on African beds for drying."",""Concern for quality:\nThe concern for quality is present at all steps in coffee production. Seedlings are grown on the farm itself, the best being chosen for planting. The harvest is selective, only well-ripened beans are hand-picked by women. After picking, a second pass is done by hand checking whether any unripe beans have been accidentally picked. When the coffee is taken to the patio for drying, lots are separated by date and variety, and they are controlled using a humidity meter, identifying the correct moment to warehouse or process them."",""The producers are also concerned about the environment and nature. They do not use chemical products and fertilize using manure from chickens and goats, coffee chaff, and the residue from pulping. The coffee fields have some trees called grevílea which provide shade, control wind, protect the soil with their leaves and also provide fertilization when these leaves decompose. The farm has a forest reserve on which hunting and logging are prohibited. Animals are always welcome; birds sing every morning and jacu birds visit every harvest.""]},""gallery"":[""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FAZENDA-DIVINO-ESPIRITO-SANTO-3.jpg?time=1691110772"",""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FAZENDA-DIVINO-ESPIRITO-SANTO-2.jpeg?time=1691110772""],""farm_information"":{""Farm Name"":""FAZENDA DIVINO ESPÍRITO SANTO"",""Farmer"":""MICHAEL FREITAS DE ALCÂNTARA""},""location"":""Chapada Diamantina, Brasil, Livramento de Nossa Senhora, Bahía, Brasil"",""score"":{""Score"":""89.16"",""Rank"":""7""},""lot_information"":{""Year"":""2022"",""Processing System"":""Pulped Natural"",""Variety"":""Catucaí 2SL""},""similar_farm"":[""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/1-fazenda-tijuco-brazil-2022/"",""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/2-sitio-bonilha-brazil-2022/"",""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/6-fazenda-gerais-brazil-2022/""]}},{""Rank"":{""text"":""8"",""value"":""{\""1\"":3,\""3\"":8}""},""Score"":{""text"":""88.75"",""value"":""{\""1\"":3,\""3\"":88.75}""},""Farm_Name"":{""text"":""FAZENDA CLAUDIO"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""FAZENDA CLAUDIO\""}""},""url"":""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/8-fazenda-claudio-brazil-2022/"",""Farmer"":{""text"":""CELIA REGINA ALVES NUNES"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""CELIA REGINA ALVES NUNES\""}""},""Region"":{""text"":""Cerrado Mineiro"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Cerrado Mineiro\""}""},""Weight__kg_"":{""text"":""360"",""value"":""{\""1\"":3,\""3\"":360}""},""Variety"":{""text"":""Catuai Amarelo 62"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Catuai Amarelo 62\""}""},""Process"":{""text"":""Natural"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Natural\""}""},""individual_result"":{""description"":{""p"":[""The history of Nunes coffee began with livestock. For many years Osmar Pereira Nunes, the patriarch of the family, took care of the herd of cattle without imagining that the most valuable fruit of this region was still to be cultivated."",""In 1984, precisely on November 24, Osmar Junior, better known as Juninho, planted 10 hectares of Arabica coffee in the soil of Cerrado Mineiro. Although his story began with his father's cattle, his passion for agriculture spoke louder, intensified by the influence of immigrants who came to invest in coffee in the lands of the state of Minas Gerais. In the following year, another 7 hectares increased the coffee plantation on Fazenda Freitas. Nowadays there are more than 400 hectares planted on the family’s 5 farms."",""From then until the present, an unimaginable revolution has taken place in the countryside and continues with the palate of the global coffee consumer. Modern machines have developed planting, handling, harvesting and post-harvesting processes, resulting in agility and a better productivity. Deep knowledge and the desire the do more have brought the Nunes Coffee farms benefits from the way they are planted to the results in the cup. There are more than 20 varieties planted, modern, regenerative management, post-harvest processes that add to the fruit and create extremely special coffees. Coffee is no longer a commodity, but a spice, a product valued and appreciated worldwide."",""Nunes Coffee has now the dedication and the same passion for coffee from the second generation, Juninho and Celinha’s children, Gabriel and Laura. Gabriel, 33, an agronomist educated at the renowned University of Viçosa. applies his knowledge to carry on and bring a more commercial vision to the family's business, focusing on developing processes to improve the quality of the beans. Laura, 30, participates on the group’s board of directors remotely. Together, the family works with passion and tenacity on the farms, uniting the traditions of the past with the innovations and technologies of new generations. Modernity demands quick decisions and brings immediate consequences. In the past, coffee was produced thinking only of volume; today, a farm’s social, environmental and financial pillars must be balanced for the business to prosper. Planting nowadays is ensuring quality, using correct soil management methods to reduce the use of agricultural inputs, being environmentally conscious and understanding what the market seeks during the harvest."",""The coffees harvested at the Nunes Coffee farms are rated as among the best in the world. Winning national and international awards, including the Cup of Excellence in 2017, is recognition of the daily work and complete dedication of everyone involved in the processes. The team relies on Maria, Maria Aparecida and Daiane, who work in the fields and on the patios. Natália, a cafeteria chef, Luciene, a machine operator, and Celinha, the family matriarch responsible for the group’s finances. It is agreed that there is not a ready recipe for an award-winning harvest, so each year between 10% and 15% of the trees are renewed to ensure uniform, high-quality harvests. The Nunes Coffee farms are in a privileged region, with ideal altitude and little rain during the harvest. This naturally produces high-quality coffees, but more is needed to differentiate them to consumers. Thus they continue investing in technology, in perfecting crop management and also testing controlled fermentation processed to investigate the drink."",""This lot of Catuaí 62, a finalist in Cup of Excellence Brazil 2022, was selectively machine harvested and underwent 60 hours of aerobic fermentation no concrete patios. Drying took place over 25 days, during which the coffee was manually raked."",""The Nunes Coffee brand has much to offer, and believes that specialty coffees still have much market share to conquer in Brazil and around the world. Nunes Coffee is preparing for this future through hard work, family unity and the certainty that they are on the right path."",""Certifications:\nRA - RA_00009282105 valid until: 30/05/2023\nNES - RCM003 valid until: 31/12/2022\nRCM - 103 valid until: 13/10/2022\nCP - F604808 valid until: 31/07/2023\n4C - IMOBR300190611024 valid until: 31/10/2024""]},""gallery"":[""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CLAUDIO-2.jpg?time=1691110772"",""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CLAUDIO-3.jpg?time=1691110772""],""farm_information"":{""Farm Name"":""FAZENDA CLAUDIO"",""Farmer"":""CELIA REGINA ALVES NUNES""},""location"":""Mineiros, Goiás, Brasil"",""score"":{""Score"":""88.75"",""Rank"":""8""},""lot_information"":{""Year"":""2022"",""Processing System"":""Natural"",""Variety"":""Yellow Catuaí 62""},""similar_farm"":[""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/3-fazenda-recanto-brazil-2022/"",""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/19-fazenda-chapadao-brazil-2022/"",""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/22-paraiso-andrade-bros-brazil-2022/""]}},{""Rank"":{""text"":""9"",""value"":""{\""1\"":3,\""3\"":9}""},""Score"":{""text"":""88.38"",""value"":""{\""1\"":3,\""3\"":88.38}""},""Farm_Name"":{""text"":""Sítio São Sebastião"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Sítio São Sebastião\""}""},""url"":""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/9-sitio-sao-sebastiao-brazil-2022/"",""Farmer"":{""text"":""Merce Jordan Araújo Silva"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Merce Jordan Araújo Silva\""}""},""Region"":{""text"":""Chapada Diamantina"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Chapada Diamantina\""}""},""Weight__kg_"":{""text"":""360"",""value"":""{\""1\"":3,\""3\"":360}""},""Variety"":{""text"":""Catuaí 144"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Catuaí 144\""}""},""Process"":{""text"":""Natural"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Natural\""}""},""individual_result"":{""description"":{""p"":[""Sítio São Sebastião’s story begins in 2005 when it was inherited from the producer’s father.

The beans are taken to Fazenda do Sertão, owned by the same group, immediately after being picked where they are washed, pulped and spread for drying to obtain a high-quality product.

As such it preserves large areas of native forests and springs – riparian forests are thus preserved."",""Social area:\n13 families, comprising 35 registered workers and around 80 total people, live on Fazenda Santa Inês in houses built by the farm. There is complete infrastructure, with running water, electricity and a sewer system. The remaining families live in the city of Olímpio Noronha 3 km from the farm. In addition to their salaries, the families also receive milk, coffee, medicine, among others.

Fazenda Campo Redondo in the city of São Tomas de Aquino, MG. At that time, the farm had pastures and the coffee that was there was leased, extractive cultivation. So Felipe decided to plant exotic varieties in the areas of pasture (Geisha, Catiguá MG2, Aranãs, Brasil Wood) and took over some of the fields that were leased. He began to focus on producing specialty coffees. Felipe is the first generation of coffee producers at Terracota."",""His thinking since the beginning has been: having exotic varieties, differentiated processing methods and focusing on the maximum quality possible."",""The lot that is participating in the Cup of Excellence this year, Terracota’s first year participating and sending a sample, is the fruit of this work. It is a lot of the Catiguá MG2 variety, its first harvest, one of the exotic varieties Felipe planted. The processing method was as follows: the lot in question was the last to be harvested. It was washed and spent one day in raffia bags. Soon after this, it went to African beds on the part of the patio that is cooler and shaded. On the African beds, the coffee spent a long period of drying, extremely slowly, for 20 days. When it reached 15% humidity, it was stored in a shed for 20 days. Here it underwent what is called intermittent drying. Finally, drying was finished on the concrete patio to 11.2% humidity."",""The lot presents sweetness, which is typical for the region, but it also brings fruity and floral nuances. This is very much due to the microclimate/terroir. The farm is at 1100 meters of elevation, and 100% surrounded by native forests, which provide a natural wind break. It also has a milder temperature than the rest of the areas."",""Terracota respects the environment and maintains a healthy relationship with its workers, partners and society. It has Certifica Minas certification, which recognizes the good agricultural practices adopted during all cultivation and harvesting, and also enables traceability of its products. Terracota is currently obtaining 4C certification."",""In addition to the social/environmental area, Felipe and his team are extremely concerned about quality control in order to maintain the excellence of their products. Thus, they have a fully equipped laboratory with a sample roaster, a humidity meter and equipment for cupping."",""Felipe’s mother, Márcia, helps with operations and finances on the farm.

For many years Osmar Pereira Nunes, the patriarch of the family, took care of the herd of cattle without imagining that the most valuable fruit of this region was still to be cultivated."",""In 1984, precisely on November 24, Osmar Junior, better known as Juninho, planted 10 hectares of Arabica coffee in the soil of Cerrado Mineiro. Although his story began with his father's cattle, his passion for agriculture spoke louder, intensified by the influence of immigrants who came to invest in coffee in the lands of the state of Minas Gerais. In the following year, another 7 hectares increased the coffee plantation on Fazenda Freitas. Nowadays there are more than 400 hectares planted on the family’s 5 farms."",""From then until the present, an unimaginable revolution has taken place in the countryside and continues with the palate of the global coffee consumer. Modern machines have developed planting, handling, harvesting and post-harvesting processes, resulting in agility and a better productivity. Deep knowledge and the desire the do more have brought the Nunes Coffee farms benefits from the way they are planted to the results in the cup. There are more than 20 varieties planted, modern, regenerative management, post-harvest processes that add to the fruit and create extremely special coffees. Coffee is no longer a commodity, but a spice, a product valued and appreciated worldwide."",""Nunes Coffee has now the dedication and the same passion for coffee from the second generation, Juninho and Celinha’s children, Gabriel and Laura. Gabriel, 33, an agronomist educated at the renowned University of Viçosa. applies his knowledge to carry on and bring a more commercial vision to the family's business, focusing on developing processes to improve the quality of the beans. Laura, 30, participates on the group’s board of directors remotely. Together, the family works with passion and tenacity on the farms, uniting the traditions of the past with the innovations and technologies of new generations. Modernity demands quick decisions and brings immediate consequences. In the past, coffee was produced thinking only of volume; today, a farm’s social, environmental and financial pillars must be balanced for the business to prosper. Planting nowadays is ensuring quality, using correct soil management methods to reduce the use of agricultural inputs, being environmentally conscious and understanding what the market seeks during the harvest."",""The coffees harvested at the Nunes Coffee farms are rated as among the best in the world. Winning national and international awards, including the Cup of Excellence in 2017, is recognition of the daily work and complete dedication of everyone involved in the processes. The team relies on Maria, Maria Aparecida and Daiane, who work in the fields and on the patios. Natália, a cafeteria chef, Luciene, a machine operator, and Celinha, the family matriarch responsible for the group’s finances. It is agreed that there is not a ready recipe for an award-winning harvest, so each year between 10% and 15% of the trees are renewed to ensure uniform, high-quality harvests. The Nunes Coffee farms are in a privileged region, with ideal altitude and little rain during the harvest. This naturally produces high-quality coffees, but more is needed to differentiate them to consumers.

This activity is truly the result of an old dream that has only been realized with the acquisition of Fazenda Cerca de Pedras São Benedito. The farm has 6 hectares of red and yellow Catuaí out of a total area of 32 hectares."",""In this new professional stage of specialty coffee production, the desire is to continue always sharing with the coffee community, especially in Chapada Diamantina and Piatã, the city where the property is located. The Piatã region sparked Silvio’s interest since the year 1999 when BSCA specialty coffee competitions and the Cup of Excellence began. Silvio is very proud to have been one of the founders and co-author of the technical protocols of this competition that brings important, valuable benefits to the entire coffee chain, from producers to consumers, bringing prosperity to all links of the value chain. Returning to Piatã, the region is blessed with unique conditions for growing extremely high-quality specialty coffees despite having historically limited rainfall. In general, coffee growing areas are small and family run. In this project and its expansion are contained all the desire to produce shade-grown coffee, harvests of perfect cherries (most of the pickers are women), post-harvest processing using the best techniques and slow drying (in greenhouses, on African beds, practically in the shade) as Silvio always suggested and now uses in his own production."",""The first harvest at Fazenda Cerca de Pedras São Benedito was in 2020 and already then using these concepts it was crowned champion of the 17th National Championship promoted by ABIC (Brazilian Coffee Industry Association) for the Chapada Diamantina region and the lot was national champion in terms of value obtained in the auction. The work team has been fundamental in the entire harvest and preparation process under the leadership of the local administrator, Kleumor Moreira, 35, a young coffee producer and neighbor."",""Silvio’s objective for the farm (another dream) is to make it into a “farm school,” bringing more science and new cultivars, always with open doors, meeting the demand for information with current topics necessary for the development of the specialty coffee value chain for all small producers, partners and students to participate. The property does not yet have any certifications."",""In 2021, during Silvio’s first time participating in Cup of Excellence Brazil, he placed 17th, and was very happy and proud of the results.""]},""gallery"":[""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cerca-de-Pedra-Farm-Fotos-de-Silvio-3-scaled.jpg?time=1691110772"",""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Cerca-de-Pedra-Farm-Fotos-de-Silvio-4-scaled.jpg?time=1691110772""],""farm_information"":{""Farm Name"":""Fazenda Cerca de Pedras São Benedito"",""Farmer"":""Sivio Leite Café""},""location"":""Chapada Diamantina, Brasil, Livramento de Nossa Senhora, Bahía, Brasil"",""score"":{""Score"":""87.19"",""Rank"":""20""},""lot_information"":{""Year"":""2022"",""Processing System"":""Pulped Natural"",""Variety"":""Red and Yellow Catuaí""},""similar_farm"":[""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/1-fazenda-tijuco-brazil-2022/"",""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/2-sitio-bonilha-brazil-2022/"",""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/6-fazenda-gerais-brazil-2022/""]}},{""Rank"":{""text"":""21"",""value"":""{\""1\"":3,\""3\"":21}""},""Score"":{""text"":""87.16"",""value"":""{\""1\"":3,\""3\"":87.16}""},""Farm_Name"":{""text"":""Fazenda Baixadão"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Fazenda Baixadão\""}""},""url"":""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/21-fazenda-baixadao-brazil-2022/"",""Farmer"":{""text"":""Rayssa Brás"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Rayssa Brás\""}""},""Region"":{""text"":""Sul de Minas"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Sul de Minas\""}""},""Weight__kg_"":{""text"":""360"",""value"":""{\""1\"":3,\""3\"":360}""},""Variety"":{""text"":""Geisha"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Geisha\""}""},""Process"":{""text"":""Natural"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Natural\""}""},""individual_result"":{""description"":{""p"":[""The 1310 meters of elevation and the fields protected by a magnificent wall of rock help tell the story of Sítio Aradillo, which is preparing to make history."",""Located in the Central-West of Minas Gerais, the farm belongs to young couple Pedro and Rayssa Brás."",""The region is blessed by the Serra da Canastra and all the natural wonders it provides."",""Rayssa inherited her love for coffee from her father and, at third-generation producer Pedro’s side, supports the movement to better value the region’s coffees."",""Through example, they inspire innovation in search of consistent quality of the beans – always balancing costs, productivity and the environment.

During the 1970s, the Andrade brothers, the third generation of the family, reestablished their coffee farms in the region."",""Fazenda Paraíso is one of the oldest coffee farms in the region. The farm has well-defined seasons, an elevation of 1100 meters, and balanced rainfall and temperature. Nature does its work, and the brothers learned from their ancestors that the least they could do to repay the universe was to respect the environment, so they are always concerned about preserving nature."",""The Andrade family’s consistent, high-quality work can be verified by its awards and international relevance. Specifically in the Cup of Excellence. Since 2016, the family has had 7 winning lots, including the champion lot in 2018."",""Coffee processing system\nProcessing is natural. The coffee is picked at the perfect stage of maturation, with a maximum of 10% green coffee cherries. After harvesting, the coffee passes through the washer where floaters are separated from the ripe and unripe fruits by density. After this first separation, the ripe and green cherries pass through an electronic sorter, which selects only the ripe coffee cherries. These ripe fruits were then used in the aerobic fermentation process, in which the coffee was fermented for a period of 72 hours in brick tanks, in the presence of oxygen. After this, the coffee dried on African beds, spread in 5 cm think layers, providing slower drying, making a higher-quality and more uniform coffee possible."",""Concern about quality\nThe farm is extremely concerned about quality. The producers carefully watch over every detail of production, until its final destination, the perfect cup. Care begins with production, harvest, post-harvest, warehousing and excessive quality control, where the sensory profile and traceability of each plot of the farm is analyzed. This is fundamental and has direct impact on the quality of the product, providing consumers with a high-quality, consistent product. The Andrade family always seeks to improve the quality of their coffees, frequently investing and seeking scientific knowledge to perfect their production processes.""]},""gallery"":[""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/AM36493.jpg?time=1691110772"",""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/FAZENDAS_COLABORADORES-89-scaled.jpg?time=1691110772""],""farm_information"":{""Farm Name"":""Paraiso - Andrade Bros"",""Farmer"":""Espolio de Maria do Carmo de Andrade""},""location"":""Mineiros, Goiás, Brasil"",""score"":{""Score"":""87.13"",""Rank"":""22""},""lot_information"":{""Year"":""2022"",""Processing System"":""Natural"",""Variety"":""Arara""},""similar_farm"":[""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/3-fazenda-recanto-brazil-2022/"",""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/8-fazenda-claudio-brazil-2022/"",""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/19-fazenda-chapadao-brazil-2022/""]}},{""Rank"":{""text"":""23"",""value"":""{\""1\"":3,\""3\"":23}""},""Score"":{""text"":""87.09"",""value"":""{\""1\"":3,\""3\"":87.09}""},""Farm_Name"":{""text"":""SÍTIO GUIOMAR"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""SÍTIO GUIOMAR\""}""},""url"":""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/23-sitio-guiomar-brazil-2022/"",""Farmer"":{""text"":""REGINALDO COSTALONGA"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""REGINALDO COSTALONGA\""}""},""Region"":{""text"":""Montanhas do Espírito Santo"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Montanhas do Espírito Santo\""}""},""Weight__kg_"":{""text"":""330"",""value"":""{\""1\"":3,\""3\"":330}""},""Variety"":{""text"":""catucai 785"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""catucai 785\""}""},""Process"":{""text"":""Despolpado"",""value"":""{\""1\"":2,\""2\"":\""Despolpado\""}""},""individual_result"":{""description"":{""p"":[""Sítio Guiomar is located 10 km from the city of Vargem Alta, in an area known for much water and greenery, in the mountains of Espírito Santo.

The producer’s father, Miguel Costalonga, relates that he participated actively in everything the farm needed, and together with him, the producer and his brother entered into coffee production. They passed through difficult times and had to leave and find outside jobs. His brother, Edevaldo, had the opportunity to work as a coffee cupper, but they never abandoned their fields. His father and mother, Alaide, continued producing coffee on the farm and did everything possible to preserve nature. In 2015, Reginaldo returned to the farm and together with the techniques his brother brought, he has dedicated himself to the maximum with everything he has learned since he was young. They have improved the quality of their crops, installed machinery and patios, employed technology to produce high-quality coffees seeking sustainable production. As they are located in a high, cold region, the harvest is selective. They pass through the fields around five times picking only the well-ripened beans."",""The lot participating in this competition was picked in August, a Red Catucaí 785 from Plot 02. It was pulped the same day it was picked and spent 12 hours in a tank with water. Then it was dried on covered African beds. Reginaldo’s wife, Aline Amorim, and his mother, Alaide Costalonga, raked the coffee every hour during the day. The coffee dried over a period of 15 days. Their one-year-old son, Gustavo, is Reginaldo’s motivation each and every day.

coffee begins in 1901 with their ancestors’ arrival in Carmo do Paranaíba, in the Cerrado Mineiro region of the state of Minas Gerais. During the 1970s, the Andrade brothers, the third generation of the family, reestablished their coffee farms in the region. Fazenda São Bento is at 1100 meters of elevation in the rural zone of Carmo do Paranaíba. It has well-defined seasons, an elevation of 1100 meters, and balanced rainfall and temperature. Nature does its work, and the brothers learned from their ancestors that the least they could do to repay the universe was to respect the environment, so they are always concerned about preserving nature."",""The farm is run by brothers Ismael and Eduardo Andrade, together with Rômulo Andrade, Ismael’s son, a fourth-generation producer in the Andrade family."",""Ismael, CEO of Andrade Bros, graduated in mechanical engineering at the Federal University of Minas Gerais. With vast experience in the production and commercialization of specialty coffees, his focus has always been on producing differentiated coffees of extremely high quality. Corroborating this concern for quality and with Brazilian coffees, Ismael is one of the founding members of BSCA (Brazil Specialty Coffee Association)."",""Eduardo, founding partner of Andrade Bros, is a doctor trained at the Faculty of Medical Sciences of Minas Gerais. Eduardo focuses on managing human resources, team training and development of post-harvest processing techniques to increase the quality of the coffees."",""Rômulo, 28, is a production engineer with a degree from the Federal University of Minas Gerais and has much experience in process optimization, which he acquired as a consultant at Accenture. He is responsible for the farms’ operations, including process management and optimization of specialty coffee production, focusing on producing greater volumes of very high-quality coffees consistently and sustainably."",""The Andrade family’s consistent, high-quality work can be verified by its awards and international relevance. Specifically in the Cup of Excellence. Since 2016, the family has had 7 winning lots, including the champion lot in 2018."",""Coffee processing system\nProcessing is natural. The coffee is picked at the perfect stage of maturation, with a maximum of 10% green coffee cherries. After harvesting, the coffee passes through the washer where floaters are separated from the ripe and unripe fruits by density. After this first separation, the ripe and green cherries pass through an electronic sorter, which selects only the ripe coffee cherries. These ripe fruits were then used in the anaerobic fermentation process, in which the coffee was fermented for a period of 120 hours in a stainless steel bioreactor, without the presence of oxygen. After this, the coffee dried on African beds in a greenhouse, spread in 5 cm think layers, providing slower drying, making a higher-quality and more uniform coffee possible."",""Concern about quality\nThe farm is extremely concerned about quality. The producers carefully watch over every detail of production, until its final destination, the perfect cup. Care begins with production, harvest, post-harvest, warehousing and excessive quality control, where the sensory profile and traceability of each plot of the farm is analyzed. This is fundamental and has direct impact on the quality of the product, providing consumers with a high-quality, consistent product. The Andrade family always seeks to improve the quality of their coffees, frequently investing and seeking scientific knowledge to perfect their production processes."",""Certifications\nRainforest | Coode: IMA-G-008702 | Valid until: 08/01/2024""]},""gallery"":[""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/DJI_0060-scaled.jpg?time=1691110772"",""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/CAM37215.jpg?time=1691110772"",""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Familia-Andrade-scaled.jpg?time=1691110772""],""farm_information"":{""Farm Name"":""São Bento - Andrade Bros"",""Farmer"":""Romulo Xavier Carneiro Furtado Andrade""},""location"":""Mineiros, Goiás, Brasil"",""score"":{""Score"":""86.94"",""Rank"":""1""},""lot_information"":{""Year"":""2022"",""Processing System"":""Natural"",""Variety"":""Yellow Catuaí 62""},""similar_farm"":[""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/3-fazenda-recanto-brazil-2022/"",""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/8-fazenda-claudio-brazil-2022/"",""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/19-fazenda-chapadao-brazil-2022/""]}},{""Score"":""86.81"",""Farm_Name"":""Sítio Cabeceira do Cachoeirão"",""url"":""https://farmdirectory.cupofexcellence.org/listing/2-sitio-cabeceira-do-cachoeirao-brazil-2022/"",""Farmer"":""Juarez Pereira Neto"",""Region"":""Matas de Minas"",""Weight__KG_"":""360"",""Variety"":""catucai 785/15"",""Process"":""Natural"",""individual_result"":{""description"":{""p"":[""Producer Juarez Pereira Neto, 59, is married to Neide Maria de Santana Pereira. They have two sons, Talles Santana Pereira and Sávio Santana Pereira. Juarez has worked with coffee for over 51 years. He began at 8, helping his father. In 2017, they acquired the land that would come to be called Sítio Cabeceira do Cachoeirão. As such, Juarez is the first generation to run the farm. Sítio Cabeceira do Cachoeira has a total of 9 hectares, at an average elevation of 875 meters, with 16 thousand coffee trees planted on 7 hectares. The other 2 hectares are set aside for environmental conservation with trees planted around springs and also for the construction of the farm’s headquarters. About 90% of the coffee planted on the farm is Red Catucaí 785/15. The remaining 10% is Red Catuaí IAC 144. Both crops are the same age, about 5 years. Juarez began producing specialty coffee in 2021, and this is the second consecutive year in the segment. In 2021, the farm was champion in the Emater specialty coffee competition and second in the Matas de Minas regional competition. All work on the farm is done by the family. Specilaty coffee processing is done by hand."",""Women are involved in the harvest and in specialty coffee production. They separate ripe cherries from unripe ones, help with drying the coffees and in screening the coffee after processing."",""Sons Talles, 32, and Sávio, 23, both help with administration of the farm and in the fields."",""Coffee processing system\nThe coffee was picked by hand. Both ripe and green coffee cherries were picked. After picking, the coffee passed through the water where impurities such as dirt, stones, sticks, shriveled and empty cherries, resulting in only ripe and green cherries. Then the coffee was sorted, the ripe beans were separated from the green ones. Only the ripe cherries were used. They were spread to dry on a cloth placed over a cement patio so they did not have any contact with impurities or humidity. Raking of the coffee was done manually without any contact between people and the coffee. That is, they did not walk on top of coffee on the ground; they used a long handle and stood at the edge of the cloth, but not on it, so that the coffee did not have contact with any bacteria. The coffee dried for about 20 to 30 days under the sun until reaching 11% humidity. Each evening during the drying period, the coffee was covered by another cloth to avoid contact with humidity during the night. Then the coffee was bagged and rested for 30 days, after which a sample was sent to the Cup of Excellence competition. After being informed that the lot qualified for the national phase, the coffee was processed and screened for 16 up. Then the coffee lot was manually sorted again, all imperfect beans were removed, only large, uniform beans remained. This coffee was sent to the certified warehouse and is currently stored in high-barrier bags.""]},""gallery"":[""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SITIO-CABECEIRA-DO-CACHOEIRAO-6.jpeg?time=1691110772"",""https://5b3ff3.p3cdn1.secureserver.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/SITIO-CABECEIRA-DO-CACHOEIRAO-4.jpeg?time=1691110772""],""farm_information"":{""Farm
