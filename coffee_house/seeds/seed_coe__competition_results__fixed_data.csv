José Augusto Peixoto is a 4th-generation coffee producer in the city of Ibirací, Minas Gerais. His father, Nelson Peixoto, produced coffee his entire life, as did his grandfather and great-grandfather, a tradition for over 150 years. He was born on his father’s coffee farm, adjacent to his current farm, Fazenda São José da Boa Vista. José Augusto remembers planting coffee trees in the yard when he was 5 years old, picking beans and going to the city of Ibirací on a mule to sell his lots with his family. Eventually, José Augusto went to live in the city, where he went to high school, the he left to study medicine. During the 70s, José Augusto started buying small farms around his family’s farm, creating his own coffee production. And thus he began Thelma and José Augusto’s over 50-year tradition of coffee production. They started selling their coffees at the local cooperative and followed the ups and downs of the commodity market in Brazil. With the passing of José Augusto’s mother at the end of the 90s and later of his father in 2012, Thelma and José Augusto inherited plots of land adjacent to theirs and over the years they built up their farm, today known as Recanto do Mato."",""Coffee processing system \nAt Fazenda Recanto do Mato, the harvest occurs from June to the end of August, the best lots of the specialty drink generally being processed in August. All of the crops are harvested separately, some by machine and some by hand. All of the Fazenda Recento do Mato coffee lots are dried naturally on patios, where they are raked and lined continually throughout the day for 7 to 10 days per lot. After drying, the coffee is transferred to granaries inside the warehouse where the coffee rests for a few days inside the cherry. The coffee rests, is separated and processed. Thelma and José Augusto have the capacity to separate coffees of screen size 16-17 and up on the farm itself. In 2015, they invested in warehousing and processing, giving the farm the infrastructure to process specialty coffee beans and send screen size 16 or 17 and up from the farm."",""Concern about quality \nThelma and José Augusto has been working over the past 10 years to improve the quality of their coffees mainly to sell them for a price based on the quality of the coffee and not that of the market. The farm employs a certified agronomist who visits regularly and applies innovative organic agricultural products. In addition to this, the farm is entirely catalogued by lot, which, during the harvest, gives them the complete ability to separate lots by cultivar and trace them through processing to maintain the properties of each lot. During the harvest, care is taken to pick only the ripe fruits and, if necessary, several harvests of a single coffee tree are done to be certain that only the ripe fruits are picked. Processing the lots at the farm itself, and not in a cooperative or mobile processing center, also permits quality measures to be maintained during the entire coffee processing process, even separation by screen. With these measures, Fazenda Recanto do mato is able to have 30-40% of its production be specialty coffees (receiving scores of 85 or above from Q-graders certified in Brazil or abroad). For the past two years, coffees from this farm have been exported directly to the Peixoto family coffee shop (José Augusto Peixoto’s daughter and son-in- law) in Phoenix, Arizona, www.peixotoco ee.com, where it is roasted in small quantities, distributed to highly-regarded coffee shops and restaurants in the American market, and served to customers of re ned taste seeking specialty coffees.""],""tr"":[]},""detail"":{""Acidity"":""Bright, citric, juicy"",""Aroma_Flavor"":""Honey, brown sugar, caramel, chocolate, salted caramel, raspberry, toasty, roasted almond, praline, dates, mandarin"",""Auction_Lot_Size__lbs__"":""6548"",""City"":""Ibiraci"",""Country"":""Brazil Naturals"",""Farm_Name"":""Fazenda Recanto do Mato"",""Farm_Size"":""-"",""Farmer_Rep_"":""Thelma de Lima Peixoto"",""High_bid"":""4.00"",""High_bidders"":""CHOI Coffee Roasters & Seoul Coffee School"",""Month"":""December"",""Other"":""Smooth, thick"",""Program"":""Brazil Naturals 2015 December"",""Rank"":""31a"",""Region"":""Minas Gerais"",""Size__30kg_boxes_"":""99"",""Total_value"":""26190.92"",""Year"":""2015""},""images"":[]},""url"":""https://allianceforcoffeeexcellence.org/farm-directory/85-67-11/""}"

The topography is dramatic and the contours of the mountains are photogenic. The coffee there is extremely healthy, and because of the large basin shape of the farm and the 4 major aspects (North facing, South facing, East facing and West Facing), the farm offers several different ripening stages and qualities. Some of the coffees are more acidic and sweeter, but show an even better body than some of the other coffees from the Carmo region. Other coffees from the farm have a more common Brazilian profile."",""The three sections of the farm that tend to be award winning all come from the South West corner of the farm called Santa Barabara, Paivas and Sardiha. The sections there are mostly Yellow Bourbón or Mundo Novo. They all tend to be over 1100 meters. Aside from the breath taking views, the coffees are delicious."",""There are four ways to get to Fazenda Monte Verde. Almost all of them require 4x4 to arrive to the farm. On the map it sits about 20 km from the nearest road in any direction. The main house of the farm is located 26 km from the city of Carmo de Minas. The mayor of Carmo tells us that it is the furthest farm that is still considered in Carmo de Minas City."",""FAL Holdings purchased the farm in January of 2014. This is our second harvest with the farm and we are extremely excited to be classified in the Cup of Excellence Naturals Competition. The last two years of extreme drought have caused a lot of stress on the plants and for some reason the coffees in the Carmo region have not done as well as Pulped Naturals, which is a nice way of saying the Pulped Natural coffees aren’t quite as sweet as they were in 2013 and before. However, the Naturals have been fantastic if not even better. This move from Pulped Natural quality to Natural quality leaves almost everyone scratching their heads."",""Quality aside, Fazenda Monte Verde is extremely special because of the people that live there. Many of the workers were born and raised on the farm. They wake up early and work earnestly. They are amazingly hospitable with guests. If you have the chance to visit our farm you will see that they go to extreme lengths when serving you lunch, making you coffee roasted on the farm and asking you to take a second or third helping of lunch. This incredible hospitality and attention to detail transfers to their daily work and is truly what leads to quality in the cup."",""As a multi-national company we have been trying to improve the lives of the staff on the farm. We have made improvements to the houses (tiling the bathrooms, for example) and are supporting several staff to get their driver’s licenses through a system we call “Up Skilling”."",""This coffee is a natural process. For us on Fazenda Monte Verde, natural process means that the coffee started to dry on the tree, floated in our separation tank and then hit the patio. For the natural process coffee, we leave the coffee bed rather thick but turn it often. The dark skin of the cherry absorbs a lot of the sunlight and the uncovered patio has a constant gentle wind wafting over the cherries. After about two days, they will have lost some of that initial moisture. The coffee is transferred into a mechanical drier for 5 days. Our mechanical drying tends to be low and slow. At a moisture reading of 11.3%, the coffee is removed and rested before hulling."",""This specific lot came from two days picking on the section of the farm we call Santa Barbara. It is a large relatively level area of the farm with altitudes between 1200 and 1260 meters.

Located within this farm there is a waterfall of a natural spring that emerges deep in the rain forest. In this zone groups of small farmers have associated in order to take alternatives to selling their coffee, that have decided to create a small cooperative of innovative growers called COMIPIL and a rural fund called MANOS CAMPESINAS, both with the objective to give a value added by drying, roasting and grinding coffee to sell locally. Traditionally coffee is harvested manually, doing it in 3 stages, first graniteo, then 2 cuts and the repela at the end. Pulping is done mechanically, then ferments in concrete tanks, classification cannel and the use of coffee subproducts in the farm.
